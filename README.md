# discord-bot
This repository contains information on how to quickly set up a functional bot in Discord using the python API. 

## Uses
Bots in Discord can track miscellaneous junk you don't want to, handle responses to events, and just generally automate out tedious tasks. I personally set my first bot up when I wanted to track information for a tabletop game I GM for. 

## This Guide
This guide will assume the user has no experience with Discord and work from there. By the end of this you should have a functional bot that can perform a few basic commands, respond to events, and save information received from users to a local drive or the cloud. Expanding from there is up to you.
